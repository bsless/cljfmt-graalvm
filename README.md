# cljfmt-graalvm

[cljfmt](https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt)
is a tool for formatting Clojure code idiomatically.

Update: cljfmt now has support for native image building.

The need arose to run cljfmt quickly without a JVM. That is all this
repo provides. Any piece of code in it is copied from
`weavejester/cljfmt` or from `clojure.stacktrace`. The code was only
copied to type hint class types the native image could not figure out.

The compile script is based on
[clj-kondo's](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/script/compile)

All credit goes to Weavejester (James Reeves, cljfmt) and Borkdude
(Michiel Borkent, clj-kondo) Stuart Sierra (stacktrace) and their
respective contributors.
